# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis
Social Media Sentiment Analysis This project uses NLP and logistic regression to analyze sentiment in social media posts. It collects data via Tweepy, preprocesses with NLTK and spaCy, and classifies sentiment using logistic regression. Results are visualized with Matplotlib and deployed interactively with Streamlit for real-time analysis.
